Problem Statement

In this assignment, we are asked to develop a walk-in clinic patient system, which is to maintain the medical records for all the patients of the walk-in clinic.

The walk-in clinic keeps the following information about all its patients: the patient's name (first and last name), address, phone number, email address and care card number.

The walk-in clinic patient system must allow the receptionist to

enter a new patient into the system
remove a patient from the system
search for a patient
modify a patient's record (for example, adding the patient's information or making a change of address, etc...).
print all its patients by ascending order of care card numbers.
